Should GitHub be your CV?
=========================

Points
------

 * Not all projects are on GitHub - you could be a major contributor to the Linux kernel without a GitHub account (although the tree is mirrored on GitHub).
 * What is the objective of the exercise? Are you trying to evaluate the quality of someone's code, the level of their contributions to OSS, or both?
 * Not all contributions happen on GitHub, even for projects hosted there. For example, someone who spends a lot of time answering questions on mailing lists will not show up in GitHub - although arguably they could use the list archives as evidence of community involvement.
 * Contributing to OSS is not the only method of giving back to the wider community.
 * Overall, doesn't seem unfair to use GitHub as supporting documentation, but not as the sole source of information. Should be seen as 'nice to have' rather than 'essential'.
