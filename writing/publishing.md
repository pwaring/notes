# Publishing

Things to look into:

 * How does one become a proofreader?
 
## Publisher guides

 * [CUP: Humanities & Social Sciences](https://authornet.cambridge.org/information/proposaluk/hss/)
 * [CUP: Production Guide](https://authornet.cambridge.org/information/productionguide/)

## LeanPub

Heard a bit about this recently, seems the current 'in thing'. Produce text in Markdown, LeanPub converts to various ebook formats. Authors can set a minimum and suggested price, and readers pay what they want.
