# KVM

KVM requires hardware virtualisation support to be present and enabled, therefore it is not an option for older/cheaper CPUs.

## Guest support

Each guest can run a different operating system or kernel.

## Networking

In order to run servers which are accessible to the outside world, public bridging mode needs to be used.
