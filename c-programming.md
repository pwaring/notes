GCC warning flags
-----------------

 * `-Wall`: Enables a large number of warnings, though not all (despite the name).
 * `-Wextra`: Enables extra warnings above and beyond `-Wall`.
 * `-Werror`: Make all warnings into errors. Effectively this means that code which produces warnings will fail to compile.
