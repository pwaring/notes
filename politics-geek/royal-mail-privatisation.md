Royal Mail Privatisation
========================

Points to cover
---------------

 * All three parties in favour at various points - check manifestos and news sites for evidence (e.g. Labour back in 2008/9?)
 * What has - and has not - been sold, e.g. Post Office remains nationalised, pension deficit absorbed by government. Stake retained which may be sold at a later date. 10% given to staff, who could request more.
 * Allocation of shares - pushed out large individual investors.
 * Huge price rise in the week following privatisation - were they sold too cheaply?

Pricing
-------

Need to consider the following factors:

 * Offer was oversubscribed, so in theory price could have been set higher. On the other hand, good to have a popular issue.
 * Was always likely to be oversubscribed given the paucity of IPOs and the yield on offer.
 * Government was advised by Lazards on pricing, so not necessarily Vince's fault. However, ministers make the final decision and the buck stops with them.
 * Uncertainty over possible industrial action in the run up to Christmas may have lead to more cautious pricing than necessary.
 * Government did price at the top of the indicated range, but failed to use their reserve power to go above if demand was strong.
 * Could claim that prices are hard to get right, but evidence contradicts this? Also, whole point of advance bookrunning is to establish the price which institutions are prepared to pay.
