# Node.js

`npm install -g grunt-cli`: `-g` means 'install globally'. Generally utilities should be installed globally, whereas app-specific packages should not.

`npm init`: Generates a `package.json` file to get you started.

npm will complain unless `package.json` has a repository URL and a non-empty `README.md` file is included.
