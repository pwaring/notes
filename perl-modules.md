Perl Modules
============

Skeleton module
---------------

Most basic package is:

```
package MyPackage;

use strict;
use warnings;
use autodie;

our $VERSION = 0.01;

1;
```

'A module is simply a file that contains one or more packages, though itâ€™s generally recommended to have one package per module.' (Beginning Perl).

Things to remember
------------------

 * Package files must always end with `1;`, since the last evaluated statement is the return value. Effectively this says `return true;`, except Perl does not have a built-in boolean data type.
 * The `package` statement is block or file scoped. By keeping each package in an individual file, you can ensure that all packages are file scoped and not have to worry about the differences.
